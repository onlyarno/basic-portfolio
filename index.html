        <p>Hello World.  I am originally from Buffalo, New York, but grew up and raised in Johnson County and
            Kansas City.  As you may imagine, I do prefer the colder seasons over summer.
            I have a twin sister, who is the goody-goody of the nuclear family.
            Our family comes from India, where we do visit every few years or so.
        </p>  
            
        <p>Anyway, I am a graduate of UMKC with a biology and chemistry major, although i like biology a tad
            bit more.  Presently, I hope to become a full-stack web-developer, and perhaps combine the two
            knowledges together.  

        </p>    

        <p>In off time, I like to relax, play the piano, socialize with closest friends, watch movies, play
            video games, and other things.
        </p>

        <p>I also love my dog more than anything else.</p>
